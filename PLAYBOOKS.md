# Playbook Starter Pack

## A) Lead Follow-Up Playbook

**Trigger:** New inbound lead, referral, or interested prospect

1. **Qualify fast**
   - Who are they?
   - What problem are they trying to solve now?
   - Urgency (now / soon / later)

2. **Respond with value first**
   - Mirror their situation in plain language
   - Share one useful insight immediately
   - Offer a specific next step (call, audit, trial, etc.)

3. **Use cadence**
   - Day 0: Initial response
   - Day 2: Short follow-up with one new insight
   - Day 5: Case-study style proof point
   - Day 10: “Close the loop” message

4. **Track status**
   - New → Contacted → Qualified → Booked → Won/Lost
   - Always include next action + date

**Definition of Done:**
- Lead got a clear response
- Next step requested
- Status + next follow-up date logged

3. **First-win plan (7–14 days)**
   - Pick one high-leverage action
   - Define measurable outcome
   - Set accountability checkpoint

2. **Set Big 3 for this week**
   - One revenue move
   - One delivery/client experience move
   - One personal/family move

3. **Time-block reality**
   - Put Big 3 on calendar first
   - Protect deep work blocks
   - Add buffer for chaos

4. **Pre-commit constraints**
   - What will be ignored/deferred this week
   - What “done” means for each Big 3

5. **Friday closeout**
   - Score week 1–10
   - Roll unfinished items forward intentionally (not by accident)

**Definition of Done:**
- Big 3 clearly defined
- Calendar reflects priorities
- Non-priorities explicitly deprioritized
