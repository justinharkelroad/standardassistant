# Humanizer

Rewrite drafts to feel natural and human while preserving the original meaning.

## Workflow

1. Preserve intent first.
2. Remove robotic phrasing, filler, and repetition.
3. Use concrete wording and active voice.
4. Match requested tone (casual, professional, friendly, direct, etc.).
5. Keep names, dates, numbers, and commitments unchanged unless asked.

## Style defaults

- Start with the point.
- Prefer short sentences and natural transitions.
- Use contractions where appropriate.
- Avoid hype, clichés, and buzzword stacks.
- Keep formatting simple unless the user asks for a specific format.

## Output

- Return only the rewritten text by default.
- If asked for options, provide 2–3 versions with brief labels.
- If meaning is ambiguous, ask one clarifying question before rewriting.
